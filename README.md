# AllAboutFP
This is my learning space for Functional Programming. <br>
I might use multiple languages for this purpose, but my priority is FSharp (F#).<br>
Thanks to <a href="www.tryfsharp.org/">www.tryfsharp.org/</a> for a good learning resources for learning FSharp.<br>
After I understand the core of Functional Programming using F#, I will try other FP languages like Haskell or OCaML or Scala or Clojure.<br>
